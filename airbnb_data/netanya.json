From the very beginning I can see that Oren was extremely picky with his pool. On the second day me and my kids did some normal splashing like everyone does in a pool and for about 5 minutes we created some waves - normal behavior. Some water obviously exited the pool  which is still every normal. Later that evening he calls me over angry and scolds me for my behavior with my kids and that too much water leaving the pool is bad and can potentially damage the filter. He also criticized me for letting my kids be on their rafts/bugie boards even though he never told me before that we couldn't use it. The next morning we saw that the pool is completely green! So of course, Oren blames us for it because some how by us making some waves and water level dropping caused the pool to turn green. I grew up with a swimming pool and never experienced this in my life. It was obvious that the pool wasn't taken care of properly and wanted to blame us for it. We decided to leave a day early since we couldn't swim and I sent a request to him to change the reservation to 2 nights and he still hasn't accepted the request. I\"m also a host on airbnb and I have never stooped this low with a a guest (called us crazy a few times to our faces). The deck also is very old and gives off a reddish rust material that stained all our clothes and we were still unable to remove it. In addition, I expected this to be a PRIVATE pool but it clearly wasn't. He can see everything from inside his house AND he told us later that he had cameras and was filming everything! This was a terrible experience and ruined our vacation.

I\u2019m not sure if the owner can do something about it but it would be really great.<br/><br/>Eli was extremely helpful and responded very fast I wish all hosts would be like this.<br/><br/>All in all I would definitely book this apartment again and recommend it to other people because its very clean and beautiful.", "created_at": "2019-07-10T10:06:10Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Great locations, very clean and nice balcony!", "created_at": "2019-06-23T10:34:25Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "This place is a fantastic choice.
