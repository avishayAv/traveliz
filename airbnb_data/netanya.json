The apartment is well located, near the promenade and the stairs to the beach. Large and bright living room is really impressive. Very beautiful view of the sea, sky and sun. Daniel has always been in touch with Whatsup. The beaches in Netanya are gently sloping with finely rammed sand. The sea is great. A 10-minute walk away is the main street of Netanya and the promenade with restaurants.<br/>There were minor flaws that I told Daniel about and he promised me to fix them.<br/><br/>\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043b\u044e \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u044f\u0436. \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435, \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0435. \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0412\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0430\u043f. \u041f\u043b\u044f\u0436\u0438 \u0432 \u041d\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435. \u0412 10 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438.<br/>\u0411\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043b\u044e \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043b \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c.", "created_at": "2018-11-07T14:34:00Z", "language": "ru", "rating": 4, "response": null}, {"comments": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u044f\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043c, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438.", "created_at": "2018-10-31T11:29:55Z", "language": "ru", "rating": 5, "response": null}]},

Matan is a super clean, prompt, and accommodative host, he thought of everything. After 14 hours of flight, coming from Chicago, we were welcomed with the best little details, like fresh homemade amazing bread he just baked for us, a bottle of Barkan wine, as well as abundance of fresh cut flower bouquets which feels the air with smells of joy.<br/>Communications were super quick and easy. He provided with tons of good information about the area and home and was always reachable. <br/>This unique and homey experience is located at the coolest neighborhood - we love the narrow street passages, and the neighborhood vibes. <br/>If you are interested in a quaint piece of true local Israel - this is the place to be! Located steps from one of the most beautiful Israeli Mediterranean beaches, near the G'dur nature preserve, a piece of heaven on earth (wish I could upload pictures) - this place is real!!<br/>We will come back again and again, it's just what we needed!", "created_at": "2021-04-11T11:09:31Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "The house with its furniture is extremely modest, but it's recently renovated and very clean. <br/><br/>Matan has a good taste (to my humble opinion) and a big heart.

The decor was nice, the beds were comfortable, the dishes were clean,  and the place was very clean overall. The location of this apartment is what makes the value so incredible. I have been to Tel Aviv 25 times through out my life and I have never stayed in a better location. Between the beach and the port of Tel Aviv there is not much more you could need, but if you do the city is right there as well. The host, David, was the most helpful host I have ever encountered while staying at an Air bnb. David told me about all the potential problems with the air bnb and outside factors before I finished booking the apartment. He was also close by all the time and when I got locked out of the apartment, he was there in 5 minutes to help me out. Overall I had a amazing experience at David\u2019s Air BnB . I would recommend for anyone looking to really enjoy all the parts of Tel Aviv the stay here.", "created_at": "2021-06-11T12:17:45Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "David is an amazing and kind host. I have rated my stay with David high, even if I stayed for only one night out of my 10 day booking. There was some unexpected construction work ( not known to the host) and when I have informed him, David agreed to refund my stay fully and help me find alternative accommodation. He even helped me with my luggage and checked if my my new accommodation is good and safe. The apartment itself is high end and in a great location in Tel Aviv, I wish I would have been able to stay longer. I truly recommend staying here and  hope to be able to book this location again in the future.", "created_at": "2021-05-27T07:36:17Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "David\u2019s place was absolutely amazing! We were sad to leave after a month stay. It was equipped with everything we needed and David was fast to respond when we reached out. The location was amazing, it\u2019s very close to many restaurants - highly recommend checking out Brooklyn pizza. The apartment over looks a cute park and we loved the morning light that comes into the apartment. The apartment has electronic blinds in every room that completely insulates. The place has an open kitchen and living room with 1 large bedroom & a shower in the room, a second smaller bedroom with a single bed and an additional detached shower and than a separate toilet. We were there during the recent war with Gaza and we\u2019re glad to find out that the building has a shelter (basement) to go to during the alarms. And the park has a very large shelter as well. I would highly recommend this place for your next stay in Israel!
