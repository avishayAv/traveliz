It includes a generous spot on a roof terrace with a view over parts of the old city (mostly churches and mosques but no view to the Temple Mount or famous Jewish sites such as the Hurva synagogue or the Western Wall). Two single iron beds pushed together, slowly and impalpably moving, surprising you with a steady canyon expanding throughout the night :-). Be careful when accessing the tiny bathroom under the five foot low arch if you want to avoid seeing stars. The kitchen nook is equipped with a two plate stove, microwave, water kettle, a hot water urn, a warming plate and a small fridge. No TV (not necessarily a disadvantage!). No washer and no dryer in the apartment but access through the host. Generally speaking, accommodation in this part of Jerusalem, specifically in the Jewish quarter is expensive. Still, the total cost of 300 US per night, fees included (we stayed three nights during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot), for a rather basic israeli-style one-room apartment is overpriced (this is part of the unfortunate trend in Israel that you often get two or three-star quality but pay four or five-star prices). The apartment is difficult to reach since there are no transportation possibilities. No buses, no taxis (which is a plus if you look for peace but a minus if you are older and/or mobility impaired). Depending on how long you plan to stay, or whether you need to carry food with you,  you have to walk a few times back and forth with your suitcases through immensely charming narrow alleys with slippery steps. The nearest parking lot is about 1 km away, which costs 60 NIS or 17 US a day.  This needs to be added to your expense.

There is a DRYER!!!!  This might not seem like a big deal to you, but my partner and I have been traveling around the Mediterranean for 6 months and this is the first airbnb in which we stayed that has had a dryer, and it was awesome to get that level of dryness in our clothes!  She has set up the kitchen so that it is very easy to maintain its kosher status, so for those who are not used to keeping a kosher kitchen (such as myself) it is no trouble at all, and for those who are, I think you can be guaranteed that it truly is kosher.  I am grateful to Irit and her apartment and certainly recommend it to Jerusalem travelers and saunterers.

We then hired him for 6 hours the next day. I would recommend anyone stay there, very comfortable home staying with a very fine family.

It\u2019s very close to the center of beit jala where you can find great restaurants, bars, churches, and the old city.
