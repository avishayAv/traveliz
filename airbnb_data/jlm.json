We enjoyed hosting you.  Glad we could help in providing your grocery list before arrival to make your stay easier and more enjoyable.  AirBnB determined the address based on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps therefore we communicated with you via the AirBnB APP well in advance of your arrival the correct address in detail, which is one house over, and even provided 2 pictures of the street and entrance to the house.  Additionally, we also met you at night upon arrival from your Taxi and helped you in with your bag to assure an easy check-in.  And for your departure we called the taxi company for you upon your request. \r<br/>\r<br/>The private entrance door to the apartment is though a car port / garage which is common to the apartment you stayed in and the one upstairs.  It was originally built along with the entire building from cement and cinder blocks which are standard insulation materials.   In the neighborhood on Shabbat and Holidays kids play in the streets,  and during the regular days people use lawn mowers and weeder machines.  Most of the time the neighborhood is very quiet.   The apartment is set back from the street and is not accessible except through the private garden of the property.\r<br/>\r<br/>We appreciated that you stayed with us on the Jewish New Year which is a 2-day holiday and on a Shabbat.  During those times the local shopping center, which is a 5 minute walk away is closed.  There is a bakery - Lehem Shel Tomer, a pharmacy \u2013 Arnona Pharmacy, a mini-supermarket \u2013 Zol Tov, 2 hair dressers, and a nail salon.  Conveniently, the apartment is a 10 minute walk to the Ramat Rachel Hotel which serves a buffet breakfast and dinner everyday which can be purchased, as well as a lobby-bar cafe, and another dairy Italian restaurant in the Ramat Rachel Spa is also available.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Regarding the location in Southern Jerusalem, that is correct.   The title description of the apartment says it is located close to Ramat Rachel and the US Embassy in Jerusalem in the Arnona neighborhood.  We are a little confused with your disappointment with the location of the apartment because your initial inquiry to us indicated that you wanted to stay close to the Ramat Rachel Hotel.\r<br/>\r<br/>We were happy to read in your review that your appreciated the extra attention and assistance that we provided for you - we were happy to do it, and we would be happy to host you again."}, {"comments": "Tami and Mitchel were great hosts.

Besides, Jerusalem Old City is 50 min walk from their apartment. Also, the bus (N. 7) station to go to the center of Jerusalem is just a few steps away from their house. <br/>Another detail that we enjoyed a lot was the welcome package they offered us, and so far it's been the first time we got this detail in our Airbnb experience as guests.", "created_at": "2019-07-06T12:51:58Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Bonsoir<br/>Notre s\u00e9jour s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9 <br/>Tami et Mitchel \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s r\u00e9actifs et nous avons pu \u00e9changer avant et pendant le s\u00e9jour<br/>L\u2019appartement est chaleureux et confortable<br/>Nous \u00e9tions en hiver et il est tr\u00e8s bien isol\u00e9 et chauff\u00e9<br/>Merci beaucoup pour cet appartement <br/>Nous le recommandons", "created_at": "2019-12-29T14:56:08Z", "language": "fr", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Nous avons trouv\u00e9 un homme sympathique et une famille tres accueillante, toujours \u00e0 nos bons soins.cet appartement  est tr\u00e8s beau, propre avec tout \u00e0  bord ,tr\u00e8s id\u00e9al pour un couple,je vous le conseil  vivement, vous ne regretterai jamais d'avoir fait la connaissance de cette belle famille", "created_at": "2019-11-09T14:13:30Z", "language": "fr", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Estuve 1 semana junto con mis padres en el apartamento de Tami & Mitchell,  fueron unos grandes anfitriones, tanto ellos dos como sus hijos!; el apartamento es bastante c\u00f3modo y fresco (fuimos en verano) y el barrio bonito y bastante seguro.

Yehudit was an amazing and very accommodating hostess, even helping us bring our luggage to the apartment.<br/>Be aware that you cannot get a taxi or car directly to the apartment due to the location in the old city, so you will have to walk at least a few minutes from any drop off point to get to the apartment.  The apartment itself is on street level so you won't have to lug a suitcase up many steps.<br/>The apartment itself is decent sized for one in the old city (2 toilets, a shower, washer/dryer, even a private small walled in courtyard though we did not go there due to the poor weather during our stay).<br/>To review, perfect location, great price for the location and quality of the accommodation, and Yehudit is amazing!

Still, the total cost of 300 US per night, fees included (we stayed three nights during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot), for a rather basic israeli-style one-room apartment is overpriced (this is part of the unfortunate trend in Israel that you often get two or three-star quality but pay four or five-star prices). The apartment is difficult to reach since there are no transportation possibilities. No buses, no taxis (which is a plus if you look for peace but a minus if you are older and/or mobility impaired). Depending on how long you plan to stay, or whether you need to carry food with you,  you have to walk a few times back and forth with your suitcases through immensely charming narrow alleys with slippery steps. The nearest parking lot is about 1 km away, which costs 60 NIS or 17 US a day.  This needs to be added to your expense. So altogether, if you are not too picky and don't mind the extra bucks for the location it is still a good choice.", "created_at": "2019-06-10T12:52:28Z", "language": "en", "rating": 4, "response": "Thank you Chaim for your  appreciation .  \r<br/>\r<br/>Indeed we are in the middle on the old city of Jerusalem, a pedestrian quarter, with an astonishing view of all the rooftop of the christian quarter. \r<br/>\r<br/>We are situated in the boarder of Armenian quater. \r<br/>\r<br/>We usually keep modest price for a great situated place ( the only exception being the Jewish feast of Chavouot)"}, {"comments": "Charming flat in a part of the old city which has lots of athmosphere.

Not so in this case and ill explain why below. <br/><br/>Straight up, due to a miscommunication, a text sent to me after I booked, I misunderstood what the host was saying and thought she could not host me.  (I think she uses (Hidden by Airbnb) translate) I was nervous I wouldn't have a place to stay and booked another location. The reason I did that is because I had not heard back on my request to clarify what she said and getting to israel from the US was so hard because of corona and I had just quarantined for 14 days at a relative all in preparation to see my son who is a lone soldier in the IDF and I hadn't seen him in over  a year. I was in a desperate situation and simply didn't understand her. I thought a reasonable minded host would have some consideration.  She did not.  When she did respond and said it was fine to stay by her I explained that I already booked another place and didn't know what to do. What ensued after was ridiculous. Hours and hours (I'm not exaggerating) of back and forth communication (including talking to air bnb who said they could do nothing unless she allowed) she refused to budge on canceling the stay unless i was willing to cancel on my end and pay $70 in fees. No thanks. So finally I had to message the second place I booked (who had been so so nice thats why I was hesitant) and explain the situation. Right away they refunded in full my stay there as they understood that I had no choice but to stay here. Ironically the second place was not in such a good location altho the price was around the same but I preferred to stay there just by the tone of their messages vs what I (Email hidden by Airbnb) plete lack of regard and caring....basically saying in so many words they needed the money because of corona. <br/><br/>Once I knew i was going to stay i asked for instructions which were sent to me in Hebrew. (By the way at this point she said she would cancel my stay if I wanted (Website hidden by Airbnb) I dont speak Hebrew so i asked for it in English. I did not get a reply.... without those details its very hard to find the place and when you do you have to figure out where to park in the back to bring your luggage upstairs and there are a LOT of stairs. It's a good thing Im reasonably strong otherwise I would have had a really hard time bringing up all our stuff. Anyway an hour later we got a response which were just the codes to get in (which we obviously saw on the page written in Hebrew and numbers we didn't need translated).<br/><br/>I can't say the place itself was bad altho it is not the same place as shown in the picture. The layout is very different. Also the bathroom (not shown at all in the pics) where the toilet is (completely separate from the shower which is opposite the narrow entry hall) is so tiny, it's almost hard to maneuver around. The fridge is tiny as well and there is no oven so to say there is a full kitchen is really a big exaggeration. That being said the rooms were mostly clean although the kitchenette area could have been a little cleaner. There was only one small garbage bag to use the entire weekend. Since communication was so bad I didn't bother messaging.<br/><br/>Overall I would NOT recommend this place as it is overpriced for what you get and the communication is so bad - unless you speak French or Hebrew, and dont mind a ton of stairs to stay in a tiny place. There are so many other options in walking distance to the western wall.

This might not seem like a big deal to you, but my partner and I have been traveling around the Mediterranean for 6 months and this is the first airbnb in which we stayed that has had a dryer, and it was awesome to get that level of dryness in our clothes!  She has set up the kitchen so that it is very easy to maintain its kosher status, so for those who are not used to keeping a kosher kitchen (such as myself) it is no trouble at all, and for those who are, I think you can be guaranteed that it truly is kosher.

I will say, you should try the Lebanese Restaurant in Abu Ghosh and the Burgers Bar just down the road.

The room itself is located in the old town not far from the Damascus gate, which is great because the shuttle from the border to Jerusalem stops not far on the other side of the gate. The room is located in Churches street however for some reason in (Hidden by Airbnb) maps this street is: Ha-Minzar ha-Ethiopi street. The house number is correct however. The location is also not far from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The room itself is a studio. You have all the basic amenities - fridge, microwave, water kettle, sink, plates, cutlery, heater, cooler. There is a comfortable double bed a table with chairs and a closet. The studio is part of an old house with thick walls and a vaulted ceiling so we didn't have to use the heater a lot even on a cold December day. I can imagine it would also be nice and cool in the summer because of this. You will have your own entrance to the room. Due to the thick walls we did however have some issues connecting to the wifi with our phones. I believe it shouldn't be an issue to connect with a laptop. This was not a big issue for us as we were able to connect by stepping out in the hallway. The host informed us this will be taken care of. All in all, my wife and I would highly recommend this place because of the coziness and the location and above all because of the host.

Fifteen minute walk to the Old City  and to the City Center restaurant area, 20 minutes to Mahane Yehuda market as well as to Ben Yehuda street shops and restaurant area. The private whole-rooftop patio with the the treetop view and morning bird show was spectacular--including a group  of 4 green ring-necked parakeets (as we learned via (Hidden by Airbnb) ) and the view and wonderful cool breeze after a hot day of touring made the apartment a welcome retreat to come home to after a hot day of touring!  <br/><br/>The studio apt itself really is quite small, but in the morning and evening when it is cool, we opened the door to the patio area and it felt much bigger.  We unpacked our clothes using the shelves and clothes bar inside and stored  our luggage out on the patio, which worked fine. The mini refrigerator was a bit of a challenge spacewise, but we made do to keep our morning fruit and milk, cheese and yogurt cold as well as some beverages. The bathroom was roomy and shower great. As noted by a prior reviewer, there is only a curtain separating the bathroom from the rest of the living area.  The bed and pillows were comfortable and we slept very well. <br/><br/>Our hostess, Effrat was friendly and helpful. While bringing up clean towels, she noticed we had rigged up a small clothes line between two patio chairs and she then brought up a clothesline frame and clothespins for us.<br/><br/>The only negative  about our whole stay occurred before our vacation started, when Efrat inexplicably refused to extend the monthly rate daily discount we were paying for our stay to a one day extension of our original chosen dates--although we made this request several weeks before arriving. She did eventually reduce that extra day cost down from the non discounted normal daily rate, but still charged us $20 more than any other day of our stay. That oddity did give a bit of a bad taste entering into our stay, but the rooftop patio and the location quickly overcame this feeling.

This free parking is so much better than doing laps around the block looking for payed parking outside ... so we kindly ask our guests to be kind and patient, then can enjoy the bonus of the parking.\r<br/>"}, {"comments": "Perfect place to stay in Jerusalem.
