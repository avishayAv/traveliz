Private spacious parking just across the road, bus stops a few steps away, playground for kids just across the road. Great for families or groups of singles. Very clean, tourist info folders, hairdryer, grill, microwave... all a well equipped kitchen needs. Very clean bedding, towels, all we needed. Loved the fact of east facing windows for extra morning light.  And cool afternoons. (And thick, dark curtains for long undisturbed sleep.) Having been there late February with friends and adult kids, the separate bedrooms and the shared living room were just perfect for us. Very cool style.

Finding a spot in Tel Aviv is hard, how detached from reality one has to be to offer that to their paying customers?. I put host in quotation marks because this guy does not care about hosting, not in the standard I know from airbnb anyway.  The best and only good part about the unit is the filtered water. Though the filter itself is so dirty and moldy it seems unsanitary. <br/>Don't waste your money here. This place is not worth your money. It is completely overpriced and unmainatined.

I walked everywhere (20-30 minutes max), though there was a bus stop right down the block if you are going farther/not a walker, and public bike docks nearby.  The beach is about 20 minutes at the closest point; bars and restaurants as close as 5 minutes.

There was only instant coffee and no coffee maker, which I didn't realize, so just something to note if you like your coffee first thing in the morning.  It was nice to have the water dispenser.  There were some problems with the wifi, but Yoav was very responsive and took care of the issues quickly.   I also bought an Israeli sim card with data, so it was less of a problem than it could have been.    He was very quick to reply to any other misc questions that I had. Self check-in and checkout were super easy with no issues.  The one negative is that the bathroom has a bad mildew smell.  It isn\u2019t horrible, but it is unpleasant.

Sad experience.<br/>Tel Aviv is awesome!  However - we had a really bad time in this place. <br/><br/>1. It statred with the place being dirty.<br/>2. continued with the wifi not working and it took them 2 days to come by and fix it.<br/>3. The TV never worked for the entire 5 days - they never fixed it! <br/>4, And for a grand finale -  in the last day -  2 hours before check-out, someone opened the door and came in the unit! The cleaning person has his own keys and simply came in without even knocking! <br/><br/>We tried to communicate with the host - but they dont provide a direc path for coommunications - only a remote reception number with a person working for them having no clue and no means to help besides saying \"im trying to contact the staff at the place and waiting for their response\". <br/><br/>Before our arrival, we sent a messege sterring how important the cleanliness is to us since since the guest (my family) is a recovering cancer patient after bone-marrow transplant - and still, the bed was dirty! The walls had food-stains on them! The floor was messy with hair and dirt. <br/>We specifically asked if the place is quite, but its located just above an espcially noisy place. When the cleaning person walked in, my guest got so scared she packed everything up a once and called me frightent to come pick her up asap.<br/><br/>We really feel we got scammed here.

Beach is close by, Dizengoff is right around the corner, Serona, the shuk and the namal are all a bus ride away. Plus there are loads of 24/7 supermarkets very close by. The apartment itself is cosy and stylish. The aircon is super effective (so good). The hosts are very quick to respond and are quite friendly. The place was cleaned before we arrived and they left us a few presents as well :) The only thing that was slightly off was the lack of cooking utensils and shampoo that would probably be expected.
