I walked everywhere (20-30 minutes max), though there was a bus stop right down the block if you are going farther/not a walker, and public bike docks nearby.  The beach is about 20 minutes at the closest point; bars and restaurants as close as 5 minutes.  The \u201cmain\u201d going out section of Rothschild Blvd is about 15 minute walking to the other end of the street.   It was really quiet with almost no street noise and no noise from other apartments.  If you have a lot of clothes to hang, or are a couple, maybe ask for some more hangers (I stayed a week and doubled up on a few, but I was there 7 nights and probably overpacked ).  There was only instant coffee and no coffee maker, which I didn't realize, so just something to note if you like your coffee first thing in the morning.  It was nice to have the water dispenser.  There were some problems with the wifi, but Yoav was very responsive and took care of the issues quickly.   I also bought an Israeli sim card with data, so it was less of a problem than it could have been.    He was very quick to reply to any other misc questions that I had. Self check-in and checkout were super easy with no issues.  The one negative is that the bathroom has a bad mildew smell.  It isn\u2019t horrible, but it is unpleasant.  There is no window in the bathroom, so I am not sure how this can be addressed.

Stroll around Shabazi Street and get an expensive but worthy frozen yogurt at Hanita. If you can avoid it, don't get to Tel Aviv by car, it's very hard to park it.

Apartments Palina really like stated in photographs: Designer apartment in the style Shabby Chic, very warm materials and textures you want to constantly touch:)   Separately we note that the apartment is very cozy and home energy, then there are nice.  Comes with everything you need to feel at home: cooking utensils (we even used oven) for a shower, clean and fresh towels and bed linen.  Also in the refrigerator were water, mint lemonade and orange juice have a coffee machine with capsules, sugar and tea.  Excellent location in the heart of Tel Aviv, 10 minutes walk to the beach, nearby there are many shops, cafes and restaurants.  Two minutes walking distance there is a supermarket, falafel bar, salad and pasta bar, as well as the best ice cream in Israel who want to eat every day:) Palina responsive and very pleasant hostess,   ready to help at any moment we would definitely come back again, we really enjoyed it! <br/>Thanks a lot Palina! :)", "created_at": "2017-09-03T10:49:58Z", "language": "ru", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Excelente ", "created_at": "2017-06-25T12:59:41Z", "language": "es", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Sehr sch\u00f6ne, saubere Wohnung in guter Lage.

It is probably worth being aware of a few things: ask for directions how to find the place as the entrance is on the side street was difficult to find. Secondly the bedroom doesn\u2019t really have proper windows, only Curtains that cover a partial window a fourth the size of the window. It is very close to the beach but in the evening depending on where you go you have to go through the closed down market which was ok but not so comfortable for two females. We ended up taking a bit of a detour as we didn\u2019t feel too safe walking the very dark alleys. Again not a huge issue but worth being aware of. Overall location is good.

We\u2019ve been traveling for over a month and it was the first Airbnb to provide us with 2 keys, which was really nice since we didn\u2019t always want to go out at the same time.

Looking forward to your next stay!"}, {"comments": "If you're an individual, a couple, or just two friends looking for a cool place to stay in Tel Aviv/Jaffa, look no further.<br/><br/>Ali and Adah's apartment is perfect. It's located at the heart of the flea market, literally a few steps away from the booths, 2 minutes from the famous Abulafia bakery (24/7) which you HAVE to visit, with at least 4 great knafe places (again, a must), malabi and sahlab stores (Jaffa is known for these yummy deserts), a stone's throw from Ali Karawan, arguably the best humous in town (if not in the entire country), and a really nice grocery store (again, 24/7) in the main street (Oley Tziyon). There are more knafe, baklawa and other interesting stores in the near-by Yefet St.<br/><br/>There's also a cosy little cafe just next door (Piece of Cake) and some of the best bars and restaurants, with street parties, live music and amazing atmosphere (try Raisa, lovely food, great vibes). Fancy a beer on Friday noon? Visit the bars (they're all at the same area, around Rabbi Yohanan St.).<br/><br/>And best of all: The beaches, promenade and old Jaffa port are literally 3 minutes away!<br/><br/>The street and surrounding alleys are mostly charming. The view from the balcony is picturesque,  with the famous clock tower looming in the distance. <br/><br/>The apartment is quaint, tastefully renovated and chic. You can tell it's old but that's part of the magic, and it'sin a pretty good condition. There are big chandeliers and beautiful artwork on the walls. The dining table can be opened if you invite friends over for a meal. And there are various cupboards and drawers if you need.<br/><br/>The shower works really well, with very hot water, and exuberant stream, as long as you  set the heater in advance (red button). <br/><br/>The TV works well, with Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime as the only options.<br/><br/>There's basic kitchenware, a fridge and a stove if you need, but honestly with such lovely food around me I wouldn't  bother.<br/><br/>The hosts were forthcoming and very communicative. Even after a misunderstanding on their part, they took full responsibility to quickly handle it, and you could tell that they, and their management team, actually cared.<br/><br/>A few things to keep on mind though:<br/>- While the apartment is great and the location is perfect, it is NOT quiet. You will get into the Jaffa state-of-mind, meaning traders talking aloud or shouting, traffic jams on Friday night with Millennials screaming from their car, drivers hooting... So if you're going you hold a vipasana workshop and need silence, then this apartment is NOT for you.<br/>- There are only (quite a few) stairs, no lift. So I don't think it's accessible, nor is it a good fit if walking upwards or carrying stuff is an issue.<br/><br/>- There's a roof you can visit, I don't recommend it as the experience is not great. Enjoy the balcony or go out instead!<br/><br/>Overall, we really enjoyed the apartment. It's well-suited for a couple, quite big, sun flooded, and if you want to enjoy Tel Aviv/Jaffa's hidden gems, do book it for a long weekend or so.<br/><br/>We can't wait to come back again!", "created_at": "2021-10-31T13:28:11Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": "Hey, Adam!

When we came, there were couple of things missing but after our request in a couple of hours it was fixed completely.<br/><br/>There is no washing machine and oven (if you want to bake something) but that is stated in the description. Everything else for living is there.<br/><br/>Wifi was not so good from time to time, but that is a problem of 99% of apartments in Tel-Aviv, so it is better to buy a local sim-card with mobile internet to be sure.<br/><br/>The house is really 1 minute from the flea market and many good restaurants. Nice bakery with good coffee is right in front of it. It took us 5-7 minutes to get to the nearest beach and just couple of minutes more to the old city of Jaffa. To get to the Tel-Aviv center you can use a bus or rent a scooter/bike. We really enjoyed staying in this apartment.<br/><br/>So, overall, if you like the atmosphere of Jaffa and flea market, I can definitely recommend this apartment.", "created_at": "2021-07-25T11:06:34Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "\u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4", "created_at": "2021-10-09T11:26:11Z", "language": "he", "rating": 5, "response": "Hey, Yuval!

Private spacious parking just across the road, bus stops a few steps away, playground for kids just across the road. Great for families or groups of singles. Very clean, tourist info folders, hairdryer, grill, microwave... all a well equipped kitchen needs. Very clean bedding, towels, all we needed. Loved the fact of east facing windows for extra morning light.  And cool afternoons. (And thick, dark curtains for long undisturbed sleep.) Having been there late February with friends and adult kids, the separate bedrooms and the shared living room were just perfect for us. Very cool style. Having been to Israel many times, here we felt instantly at home and like locals.

He was ready to answer and help us any time we needed it. We arrived earlier and got a chance to meet Li in person. He was very kind and offered us an upgrade (it was just on the next street from our originally booked apartment). The apartment was not ready for our arrival so we just left our stuff and went to explore the city. When we came back, everything was cleaned and ready for our stay. The location of the house is absolutely perfect - just a minute walk to the beach, so I took my morning tea cup and enjoyed it by the sea. So we just LOVED our stay at Lis place. Highly recommend this place and Li as a host!", "created_at": "2020-01-18T12:35:46Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "Really nice place to stay, would definitely book again", "created_at": "2020-01-13T14:51:40Z", "language": "en", "rating": 5, "response": null}, {"comments": "The place is decorated in basic \"student\", but is glorious filled with light.

The location was perfect in the middle of the city 2 minutes walk to the beach and 2 minutes walk to the market (which is really important as grocery stores in Tel Aviv are super expensive and shopping in the market is much cheaper and more fun :). The hospitality was super - they let us have a later check out as there was no one checking in immediately after us and I even left my handbag there and they kept it safe and arranged for my friend to pick it up for me - they really took care of us :).

The apartment is in need of renovation and reminds me on my studenthood. It was ok as we have been only a couple of guys. I would definitively not stay in the apartment with my girlfriend. <br/><br/>The biggest selling point of the apartment is it\u2019s location, as the beach and local market is in walking distance!
